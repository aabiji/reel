A video player. Built in C using FFmpeg and SDL.
I watch *a lot* of videos, so how does video playback work?
[This is a nice guide](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/tutorial01.html)

TODO:
- build a small ui using SDL to show a single image
- Use debugger to trace the code execution path

Sub projects:
- Renderer (OpenGL?)
- GPU accelerated video decoding (ffmpeg stuff)
- Sound playback
- Some way to sync sound and video
- Do multiple things on different threads
- Basic UI (take a look at microui)
- Subtitles using WhisperCpp???

    - [] Pause
    - [] Seek
